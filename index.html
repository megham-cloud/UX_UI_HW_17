            <p>I am Megha Mahapatra, a budding mathematician turned UX/UI designer. I was drawn to mathematics for the logical and analytical problems it presented, but I found my calling in UX/UI design since it allows me to get creative while also solving problems analytically. 

                I absolutely enjoy stepping into the shoes of users in order to explore their world of thinking. I also love the design thinking process for its encouragement of frequently testing solutions and learning from our failures to produce even better designs backed in evidence.
                
                My skills include executing the design thinking process by using tool such as Miro, Figma, Adobe XD, and inVision.

                When I am not working on UX design, you can catch me gawking at the stars while strolling around the neighborhood in the early evening. I also spend countless hours reading fantasy novels (I am currently losing my mind over Brandon Sanderson's novels and I love it), and practicing the keyboard.
